**DEVELOPMENT NOTES**

JavaScript, style sheets and Bootstrap files were minimized into more manageable files using CodeKit, and saved into the folders within the "_" folder.  CodeKit must be running during development to affect change to minimized files.  Manual compile
may have to be applied in some cases.

Human readable files are located within the components folder and start with an underscore. "_".

The files were compiled in CodeKit with the following settings.

**Styles**
1) /_/components/less/_mystyles.less TO /_/css/mystyles.css (note the removal of the underscore)
	- Do not compile directly is unchecked
	- Output Style: Compressed (YUI)
	- Debug Info in CSS: None

2) /_/components/less/_bootstrap.less TO /_/css/bootstrap.css (note the removal of the underscore)
	- Do not compile directly is unchecked
	- Output Style: Compressed (YUI)
	- Debug Info in CSS: None

**Scripts**
1) /_/components/js/_bootstrap.js TO /_/js/bootstrap.js (note the removal of the underscore)
	- Do not compile directly is unchecked
	- Check Syntax With: Nothing
	- Then: Concatenate + minify

2) /_/components/js/_myscript.js TO /_/js/myscript.js (note the removal of the underscore)
